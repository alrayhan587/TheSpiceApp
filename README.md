This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

# Vocaverse - Learn Languages with Technology

Vocaverse is a language-learning app built with **React Native**. It integrates various features to help users learn languages in an interactive way.

## Features
- ðŸ“¢ **Social Media-Style Posting System** â€“ Share and engage with language-related content.
- ðŸ¤– **AI Chatbot** â€“ Practice informal conversations using the Google Gemini API.
- ðŸŽ® **Gamified Learning** â€“ Learn new words and phrases through interactive games.
- ðŸŽ¥ **YouTube Video Integration** â€“ Watch and listen to videos for better comprehension.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native** â€“ For cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Firebase** â€“ Used for database services.
- **Google Gemini API** â€“ Powers the AI chatbot.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vocaverse.git
   cd vocaverse
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npx react-native start
   ```
4. Run the app on Android:
   ```sh
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

# How to run 

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
